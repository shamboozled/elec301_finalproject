All of the data used in our scripts is in the form of pickles. The knn.py file contains the code used to create the pickles, and the pickled data is available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17Q7pcLwrEXgqRLKaYmKkJtDip8KcjaSu?usp=sharing

Our main models are deep_audio_classifier.py, knn.py, and ridge.py, with deep_audio_classifier.py containing our most successful neural network.
